# SimpleXMLRPC for PHP4
  (But also works in PHP5)

SimpleXMLRPC differs from other XMLRPC PHP implementations because of the automatic conversion of a PHP array to an XMLRPC message and VISA VERSA. So no difficult things with XMLRPC types.  It's all being done automatically!  Besides CURL there are NO special DEPENDENCIES. A normal installation of PHP4 should do it!

This code was written in 2003! So long time ago but still working ;-)
