Documentation is in the making...

For now:
- See in the file testSimpleXMLRPC.php for an example how to work with the client.
- See the testServer.class.php how to implement a SimpleXMLRPC server
- See index.php for how to work with the Server.

- Logging
- In case you want to log the xmlrpc traffic you have to fill in the logdir in the SERVER?CLIENT class for logging
